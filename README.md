### 2. **ViT-LSTM: Image Caption Generation**  
**Authors:** Astha Kathar, Mithil Gogri, Arsh Mathur, Pratiksha Patil  
**Abstract:**  
This paper presents a novel image captioning approach integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) for feature extraction with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for caption generation. It demonstrates strong performance on the Flickr8k dataset, achieving high BLEU scores and surpassing traditional CNN-RNN architectures.  
**Key Topics:** Image Captioning, Vision Transformer (ViT), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Deep Learning, Visual Feature Extraction  
- üìä BLEU-1 Score: `0.9961`  
- üìä BLEU-4 Score: `0.9901`  
- üóÇ Dataset: Flickr8k
