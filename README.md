2. ViT-LSTM: Image Caption Generation
Authors: Astha Kathar, Mithil Gogri, Arsh Mathur, Pratiksha Patil
Abstract: This paper presents a novel image captioning approach integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) for feature extraction with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for caption generation. It demonstrates strong performance on the Flickr8k dataset, achieving high BLEU scores and surpassing traditional CNN-RNN architectures.
Key Topics: Image Captioning, Vision Transformer (ViT), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Deep Learning, Visual Feature Extraction.
BLEU Scores: BLEU-1: 0.9961, BLEU-4: 0.9901
Dataset Used: Flickr8k dataset
